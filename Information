WinDirStat is a disk usage statistics viewer and cleanup tool for various versions of Microsoft Windows.

On start up, it reads the whole directory tree once and then presents it in three useful views:

The directory list, which resembles the tree view of the Windows Explorer but is sorted by file/subtree size,
The treemap, which shows the whole contents of the directory tree straight away,
The extension list, which serves as a legend and shows statistics about the file types.

The treemap represents each file as a colored rectangle, the area of which is proportional to the file's size.
The rectangles are arranged in such a way, that directories again make up rectangles, which contain all their 
files and subdirectories. So their area is proportional to the size of the subtrees. The color of a rectangle 
indicates the type of the file, as shown in the extension list. The cushion shading additionally brings out the 
directory structure.
